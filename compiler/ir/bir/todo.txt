Properly handle external (not BirElement) symbols
Properly handle IrExternalPackageFragment, which is not directly attached to the IR tree - maybe also add externalPackages child to BirModuleFragment
Back references
    Decide on arrays vs. linked lists - measure perf, esp. removing element
    Protocol for (sub)tree attach/detach
    Decide on egaer/lazy removal of back references
    Properly handle multiple refs to the same element (if that can ever happen)
    Investigate using multiple 'channels' of back refs (dedicated back refs)
    Reimplement correspondingProperty with back refs
Reshape BIR tree
Additional per-element storage
By class element cache (getAllElementsOfType)
Tree mutation-while-traversing protocol
Maybe eventually remove descriptors, but they seem necessary for now
Reorder fields in Impl classes even more
Try to reduce symbol hierarchy - esp. for removed by-private-symbol references
